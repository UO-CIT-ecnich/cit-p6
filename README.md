# Description
Reflecting on the entire project, I have gained valuable experience in creating and working with classes in JavaScript, specifically focusing on inheritance. By implementing the Shape, Rectangle, and Triangle classes, I was able to understand the concept of using a base class to provide common functionality for child classes.

Throughout the project, I practiced debugging code and interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete the assignment. This helped me strengthen my problem-solving skills and allowed me to apply modern JavaScript syntax effectively.

In Part 4, I created the Shape base class and tested its functionality. By defining the class and implementing the constructor and the perimeter method, I learned how to use the this keyword to create class properties and access them within class methods. Additionally, using the reduce() method to calculate the perimeter value and the ternary operator to handle edge cases provided me with a better understanding of these JavaScript features.

Moving on to Part 5, I implemented the Rectangle class by inheriting from the Shape class using the extends keyword. This allowed me to reuse the common functionality from the Shape class while adding specific functionality for rectangles. Creating the constructor and implementing the area method helped me solidify my understanding of class inheritance and the usage of super() to call the parent class constructor.

Similarly, in Part 6, I implemented the Triangle class by inheriting from the Shape class. By using the extends keyword and following the same approach as with the Rectangle class, I was able to create a Triangle class with its own constructor and area method, incorporating Heron's formula.

Finally, in Part 7, I created a generic block of code to process an array of side arrays. By iterating through the array using a for...of loop and utilizing techniques such as variable initialization, switch statements, spread syntax, and template literals, I successfully processed the data and produced the expected output.

Overall, this project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in creating and working with classes in JavaScript, focusing on inheritance. I feel more confident in my understanding of class concepts, inheritance, and modern JavaScript syntax.
